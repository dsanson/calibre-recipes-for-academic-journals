# This is a template for journals hosted at

# To use, copy this template, and replace 'title' and 'titleshortform'
# as appropriate, e.g.,
#
# title          = u'British Journal of Aesthetics'
# titleshortform = u'bjaesthetics'
#
# The titleshortform is the slug found at the beginning of the url for 
# the journal's webpage, e.g., http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/
#
# You might also need to adjust the filter at the end of the template
# to skip extraneous front and back matter specific to the journal
# in question.
